# SQL--Alchemy-Challenge

I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of thr climate database.

All of the following analysis were completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

After completing the initial analysis, I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I have developed 
using Flask jsonify to convert the API data into a valid JSON response object.
